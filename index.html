			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				<abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet">Css</abbr> is a rule based language made to put on some styling on our <abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">html</abbr> by selecting the desired element we wish to make fancy.
			</p>
			
			<p>From CSS1 to CSS3, selectors - ways and means to selecting/choosing elements on our document - have evolved as they got more and more defined as a structure or a condition through which the computer determines which element in the document corresponds the most.</p>

			<p>And now we can be either very specific or vague and very varied in our selection, as it goes from selecting an element or a description of an element or a group of elements we would like to select</p>

			<p>And at the same time, this subject is the one I have the hardest time with. Therefore to help myself, following is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#selectors">table summarising the selector syntax</a> gotten from the official site of <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>

			<p>We see each of them</p>
